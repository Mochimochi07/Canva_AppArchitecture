Fullstackapp

This is a whole app architecture of a fullstackapp.
I made it because i want to know how these thing connects.
Im not going for the front end anyways.
Well, i might use xojo for fetching apis.
Theres a lot of confusion going on with the term "API"
API is more of a middle layer that has protocols for connecting the front and the back.
its not certainly a server because API is a layer.
having APIs in the app will give some improvement to the flow.
