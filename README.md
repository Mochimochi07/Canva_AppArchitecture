# Canva_AppArchitecture
This is my whole architecture using Canva.

I made this repository because i want to learn how to implement apps and how these things flow.

its kinda hard to envision how it flows without drawing it actually.

like the input, process and output part.

Well i want to pursue IOT so i kinda need to learn this.

i love making flowcharts and i like making things a little futuristic so i made these as hobbies.

Making these are fun for me because i constantly learn the functionalities which help me learn reverse engineering very well.

Reverse engineering is a must when learning how to analyze virus and other stuffs within the sus gifts and trojans from attackers.

Reverse engineering is also useful in analyzing data in data science which helps me connect the dots to form a new model or to make a new discovery.

App architecture is a must for appdev, datascience(dashboards,models,etc),and cybersecurity(virus functionalities,tools, vulnerabilities,etc) because it gives sacalability and good collaboration in open source projects.


feel free to analyze my repository.

note:i might add an architecture per server repository in my github.
